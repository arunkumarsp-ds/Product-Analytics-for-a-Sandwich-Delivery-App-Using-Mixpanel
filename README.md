# Product Analytics for a Sandwich Delivery App  

## Overview  
This project is an imaginary case study for a sandwich delivery app, **Randosando**, created as part of [Product Analytics Micro-Certification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11BVt49r36dm14PtrAmMVLbKhhiEdlVC9/view?usp=sharing) By Product School. The primary goal was to gain familiarity with the basics of product analytics, focusing on customer behavior, acquisition, and retention metrics.  

## Key Learnings  
Through this case study, I explored:  
- **Product Metrics**:  
  - Customer behavioral metrics  
  - Customer acquisition metrics  
  - Customer retention metrics  
- **Experimentation**:  
  - Analyzing app performance in controlled and variant environments
  - 
## Dataset Generation  
The dataset for this project was created using a Node.js script provided during the certification.  
- I ran the script locally on my computer using the command prompt.  
- The script required pasting our Mixpanel token and secret, which allowed it to import the dataset into our Mixpanel account.  
- This process generated data for 5,000 users, simulating real-world user interactions for the project.  
As I used the free version of Mixpanel, I couldnâ€™t export the dashboards or create more than 5 reports, so I took screenshots.  

## Deliverables  
- Developed two simple dashboards:  
  1. **Behavioral Metrics Dashboard**: Tracking user interactions and engagement

## Purpose  
This project serves as an introductory exposure to product analytics, with a focus on understanding foundational concepts.  

## Note  
While not as intensive as my other data science and data analytics projects, this case study provided a foundational understanding of product analytics concepts.
